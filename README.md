# Project: Getting and Cleaning Data

## Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning and preparation for a dataset of smartphone accelerometer readings. The goal is to create a tidy data set suitable for analysis.

## Files
- `run_analysis.R`: R script to process and tidy the data.
- `CodeBook.md`: Explains variables, transformations, and data cleaning steps.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The final tidy dataset.

## Instructions
1. Place the `run_analysis.R` script in your working directory.
2. Run the script in R. It will download the dataset, clean, and prepare the data, outputting `tidy_data.txt` in the working directory.
